## Configuration Files

All pre-defined Configurations can be found in the folder.

```
src/assets/config
```

Details about the Files can be found it App Config Section of this Documentation Site.

> Note: adjustments in the JSON Files not updating the Shared State after the App is started once, as the Shared State exists already. You can use the Shared Client State Service API to delete an already initializes App Shared State again.

## Shared State

TIBCO Cloud™ Live Apps Shared Client State Service provides a mechanism for storing and publishing UI state information. For these client-specific customization parameters we use just the PUBLIC State - This type of State can be read by all users in the subscription, but can be updated or deleted only by users with App OWNER or AUTHOR roles.
