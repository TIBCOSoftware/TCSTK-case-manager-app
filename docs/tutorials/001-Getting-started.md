## Getting Started

You will find here a series of tutorials to help you get started and some more advanced subjects.

First of all, we want to get you started and get your environment ready with your own version of the Case Manager Application Template.


### Installation prerequisites

We are using Nodejs, NPM and Angular CLI, so you will have to install all of theses.

To check if you have NodeJS you can try
```console
node -v
```

[Install NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

[Install Angular CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli)

#### Instructions for Mac 

1.) Using Homebrew you will get the latest version of NodeJS installed running this command
```console
brew install node
```
Note if you do not have Homebrew and have an error in the above command, install it with the following and re do the command after 
```console
xcode-select --install   
```

2.) Then install Angular CLI 
```console
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

#### Instructions for Windows 

get latest Windows Installer for Node.js and NPM from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the Installer Steps.

Alternatives

```
cinst nodejs.install
```

scoop install nodejs
```

### Use Applicatiton Schematic Template from NPM

1.)  private NPM Server
Set the registry to the currently private TIBCO Cloud Starter NPM server, for the @tibco-tsctk scope:

```console
npm config set @tibco-tcstk:registry http://application-lb-npm-1392137160.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com/
```

2.) Install the CaseManagement App Template
Install the application template on a global level

```console
   npm install -g @tibco-tcstk/application-template
```

3.) Build App
   Build a new cloud starter application using the template
   
   
```console
      ng new --collection=@tibco-tcstk/application-template MyAwesomeCloudStarter
```

4.) Start App
Go into Cloud Starter folder and start it up
Becarefull, you will need to use only one of the following series of commands depending on where your subscription is based (to know more about this, you can see details here TODO)

The following command will let you use a Europe based subscrition
```console
cd MyAwesomeCloudStarter/
npm run serve_eu
```

The following command will let you use a US based subscrition
```console
cd MyAwesomeCloudStarter/
npm run serve_us
```
Now you can browse your Case Manager Application on: https://localhost:4200/
